```info
 WAR and Wins Above Average are computed at the team/position level by prorating the players' team-season totals by time played at the position, so they may not represent exactly what the player did at that position, but rather it assumes they were equally valued at each position. Fielding Runs is based on actual time at the position.

You can convert WAR to a team record by taking wins = WAR + .294*G and losses = G-wins. You can convert WAA to a team record by taking wins = WAA + .5*G and losses = G-wins.
